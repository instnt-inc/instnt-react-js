# Prerequisites

* Sign in to your account on the Instnt Accept's dashboard and create a customer signup workflow that works for your company. Refer [Quick start guide](https://support.instnt.org/hc/en-us/articles/4408781136909) and [Developer guide, ](https://support.instnt.org/hc/en-us/articles/360055345112-Integration-Overview) for more information.

* The integration of SDK depends on your workflow; read the [Instnt Accept integration process,](https://support.instnt.org/hc/en-us/articles/4418538578701-Instnt-Accept-Integration-Process) to understand the functionalities provided by Instnt and how to integrate SDK with your application.

# Getting Started

* Instnt React SDK is comprised of React components, Javascript library functions, and an event propagation mechanism to facilitate communication between application, Instnt SDK, and Instnt's APIs. 

* Instnt React SDK is built on top of Instnt core JavaScript Library which provides the base functionlity and event triggering mechanism that React SDK depends on. For more information please refer to this following article https://support.instnt.org/hc/en-us/articles/4997119804301

* To begin utilizing Instnt React SDK, open the terminal and enter the following command to install Instnt's React components:

```sh
npm i @instnt/instnt-react-js
```

# Quick Start Setup

  # Step 1 : Setup InstntSignupProvider component
  After installing the Instnt npm package, import Instnt's React Workflow component called **InstntSignupProvider**.
  ```jsx
  import { InstntSignupProvider } from '@instnt/instnt-react-js'
  ```

  * **InstntSignupProvider**- This component provides the functions to render and initiate the signup process. InstantSignupProvider acts as a top-level container component responsible for initiating the session and returning the accompanying Javascript functions and configurations that your application can use to perform different actions. It occurs during the mounting phase of this component.  

  * Wrap up your signup components with InstntSignupProvider. In the example app included in the SDK, only one of the child components gets rendered based on the `activestep` state.

  ```java
  <InstntSignupProvider 
    formKey={formKey} 
    onEvent={onEventHandler} 
    serviceURL={serviceURL}>

    {steps[activeStep]}

  </InstntSignupProvider>
  ```


  # Step 2 : Setup workflow steps for InstntSignupProvider component
    FormKey contain below configuration :
    ```javascript
    KYC is Disabled
    OTP is Disabled
    Document Verification is Disabled
    ```

  Set-up the workflow steps:

```javascript
  const steps = [
    <GettingStarted />
    <EnterName/>,
    <EnterContact/>,
    <ShowProgress/>,
    <EnterAddress/>,
    <ShowProgress/>,
    <ShowDecision/>,
  ];
```

  # Step 3 : Submit Signup Form Data for InstntSignupProvider component
  Submitting Form Data via calling method we get in instnt object after transaction initiated.

  ```javascript
  instntObject.submitSignupData(formData)
  ```
  Where as,

  * **instntObject** is [`instnt object`](#setup-for-instntsignupprovider-component)

  * **formData** is like

  ```javascript
  city : "testCity"
  country : "testCountry"
  email : "test@gmail.com"
  firstName : "test"
  instnt_token : "eyJmb3JtX2tleSI6InYxNjU4NDgyNzI5MTMwMDMyIiwiY2xpZ"
  instnttxnid : "2e73aacd-0699-4f9a-8f36-c84195b46966"
  mobileNumber : "(147) 263-661"
  physicalAddress : "testAddress"
  state : "testState"
  surName : "testlastName"
  zip : "test123"
  ```
  * **instnt_token** is get from [`instnt object`](#setup-for-instntsignupprovider-component)

  ```javascript
  instnt_token : "eyJmb3JtX2tleSI6InYxNjU4NDgyNzI5MTMwMDMyIiwiY2xpZ"
  ```

  * **instnttxnid** is get from [`instnt object`](#setup-for-instntsignupprovider-component)
  ```javascript
  instnttxnid : "2e73aacd-0699-4f9a-8f36-c84195b46966"
  ```

# Setup for InstntSignupProvider component

After installing the Instnt npm package, import Instnt's React Workflow component called **InstntSignupProvider**.

```jsx
import { InstntSignupProvider } from '@instnt/instnt-react-js'
```

* **InstntSignupProvider**- This component provides the functions to render and initiate the signup process. InstantSignupProvider acts as a top-level container component responsible for initiating the session and returning the accompanying Javascript functions and configurations that your application can use to perform different actions. It occurs during the mounting phase of this component.  

* Wrap up your signup components with InstntSignupProvider. In the example app included in the SDK, only one of the child components gets rendered based on the `activestep` state.

```java
<InstntSignupProvider 
  formKey={formKey} 
  onEvent={onEventHandler} 
  serviceURL={serviceURL}>

  {steps[activeStep]}

</InstntSignupProvider>
```

* **InstntSignupProvider** works as follows:
  1. connects to Instnt’s backend API on mount and initiates a new transaction identified by a unique transactionID. 
  2. It also downloads additional scripts and client side APIs. 
  3. The calling application should pass the **form_key** and an event handler function to this component.

  **form_key** - This is the id of the workflow you created in the Instnt dashboard, and you want to be powered by Instnt.

  Example: form_key= v766520100000

* InstntSignupProvider invokes onEventHandler callback function on successful initialization, passing a globally available reference to  [`instnt object`](#instnt-object) and associated SDK functions listed [below](#events).

* The application should store this [`instnt object`](#instnt-object) and its context for referencing during the signup process and invoke the properties of the function of this object to communicate with Instnt API.

* Once Instnt SDK is initialized, it binds the `onEventHandler` function and emits `transaction.initiated` event. The app can then render any subsequent components or act on the tasks associated with the signup process.

* Once an end-user/applicant fills the signup form, the application can invoke **instnt.submitData** to process the signup request.


# Document Verification

Document verification feature is applicable if you have enabled it during the workflow creation.

When this feature is enabled, the physical capture and verification of selfies and Government-issued identification documents such as Passports and Driver's Licenses are available.

Read the [Document Verification](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.instnt.org/hc/en-us/articles/4408781136909%23h_01GXC1F0V6A29QWRRHD3FHZ0YM&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1681917534768543&usg=AOvVaw3X8_CWqYSpv0vH2-sgcxFw) section of the Quickstart guide to understand better how to enable the feature.

## Document Verification Pre-requisites

* Web applications running on mobile-react can utilize Document Verification.
 
* Latest iOS and Android mobile devices with Chrome or Safari browsers and good quality camera are supported for document verification.
 
* Desktop devices (laptops, PCs) are unsupported due to the poor quality of embedded cameras and lack of gyroscopes for orientation detection. While the feature will work on devices running Chrome or Safari browsers, the experience can vary.
 
* Do not include HTML tags with IDs containing the prefix 'aid.' e.g. `<div id=’aidFooter’>` in your web app as this prefix is reserved to be used by the toolkit. 

* Document verification requires end-to-end communication over SSL to get permission to use the device camera.
    

## Setup for InstntDocumentProcessor component

1\. `import` Instnt's React components:

`import { InstntDocumentProcessor } from '@instnt/instnt-react-js'`

2\. InstntDocumentProcessor component is a child component that can be composed and nested in InstntSignupProvider, and each render of this component initiates a document capture event.

3\.  Instnt SDK includes various partner libraries, one of which is responsible for the document capture. InstntDocumentProcessor abstracts the document capture functionality by providing a simplified React component interface over our partner library.

4\. Your application can include any number of steps in the signup process by having its own react components as child components of `InstntSignupProvider`.

### Example configuration

Set-up the workflow steps:

```javascript
  const steps = [
    <GettingStarted />, //Step 0 == activeStep
    <EnterName data={formData} errorMessage={errorMessage} onChange={onSignupFormElementChange}/>,
    <EnterContact data={formData} errorMessage={errorMessage} onChange={onSignupFormElementChange} mobileNumberOnBlur={mobileNumberOnBlur}/>,
    <EnterOtpCode errorMessage={errorMessage} setOtpCode={otpCodeEntered} onChange={onSignupFormElementChange}/>,
    <ShowProgress message={otpVerifyProcessingMessage}/>, //step 4
    <EnterAddress data={formData} errorMessage={errorMessage} onChange={onSignupFormElementChange}/>,
    <ChooseDocument customDocCaptureSettings={customDocCaptureSettings} onToggleDocCaptureSettings={onToggleDocCaptureSettings} onDocumentTypeChanged={onDocumentTypeChanged} />, // step 6
    <InstntDocumentProcessor documentSettings={frontLicenseSettings} />, //DL front
    <ReviewCapture documentSettings={documentSettingsApplied} captureResult={captureResult} />, // step 8
    <InstntDocumentProcessor documentSettings={backLicenseSettings} />, //DL back
    <ReviewCapture documentSettings={documentSettingsApplied} captureResult={captureResult} />, // step 10
    <InstntSelfieProcessor selfieSettings={selfieSettings}/>, //selfie
    <ReviewCapture documentSettings={documentSettingsApplied} captureResult={captureResult} />, // step 12
    <ShowProgress message={formSubmitProcessingMessage}/>,
    <ShowDecision decision={decision} restart={restart}/>,
  ];
```

* As in the above example, `InstntDocumentProcessor` gets initialized multiple times to capture both the front and back sides of the license. In case of license, the front capture is required with back capture can be optional. In case of passport, one time initialization to capture the front info page of the passport is sufficient. 

* The component has an auto-upload feature which is turned on by default. It uploads the image to Instnt cloud storage once the image gets captured successfully. 

* This component triggers different events based on the capture success, like file uploaded, etc. 

* On successful capture, it returns the captured image and the related configurations to your application so that the application can decide to use the captured image or retake.

* The InstntDocumentProcessor component takes a documentSettings parameter which is a simple JavaScript Key-value pair object. This object can be used to override the default document capture configurations. Below is an example configuration - 

```javascript
const frontLicenseSettings = {
    documentType: "License",
    documentSide: "Front",
    frontFocusThreshold: 30,
    frontGlareThreshold: 2.5,
    frontCaptureAttempts: 4,
    captureMode: "Manual",
    overlayTextManual: "Align ID and Tap <br/> to Capture.",
    overlayTextAuto: "Align ID within box and Hold",
    overlayColor: "yellow",
    enableFaceDetection: true,
    setManualTimeout: 8,
    backFocusThreshold: 30,
    backGlareThreshold: 2.5,
    backCaptureAttempts: 4,
    isBarcodeDetectedEnabled: false,
    enableLocationDetection: false
  }
```
* The customers are only expected to use the first two settings documentType and documentSide in general to setup this component.

* For more details about Document verification workflow steps please refer to this article https://support.instnt.org/hc/en-us/articles/360045431031

## Setup for InstntSelfieProcessor component

1\. `import` Instnt's React components:

`import { InstntSelfieProcessor } from '@instnt/instnt-react-js'`

2\. InstntSelfieProcessor component is a child component that can be composed and nested in InstntSignupProvider, and each render of this component initiates a document capture event.

3\. Instnt SDK includes various partner libraries, one of which is responsible for the selfie processor. InstntSelfieProcessor abstracts the selfie capture functionality by providing a simplified React component interface over our partner library.

4\. Your application can include any number of steps in the signup process by having its own react components as child components of `InstntSignupProvider`.

5\. Similar to InstntDocumentProcessor component, SDK provides InstntSelfieProcessor component which can be used to capture a selfie image. The setup and function of this component is very similar to InstntDocumentProcessor. Here is an example of selfieSettings parameter object that can be used to costomize its behavior.

*

```javascript
const selfieSettings = {
    enableFarSelfie: true,
    selfieCaptureAttempt: 4,
    captureMode: "Auto",
    compressionType: "JPEG",
    compressionQuality: "50",
    useBackCamera: false,
    overlayText: "Align Face and Tap button</br> to Capture.",
    overlayTextAuto: "Align Face and Hold",
    overlayColor: "#808080",
    orientationErrorText: "Landscape orientation is not supported. Kindly rotate your device to Portrait orientation.",
    enableFaceDetection: true,
    setManualTimeout: 8,
    enableLocationDetection: false
  }
```
* Please refer to the reference application bundled with React SDK for more detail code examples.

* The SDK by default loads a optimized set of configurations based on the device famility for well known devices.

* Please note that InstntImageProcessor component is removed in the latest version of the SDK but customers are encouraged to use specific components InstntDocumentProcessor and InstntSelfieProcessor.

# OTP (One-Time Passcode)

OTP functionality can be enabled by logging in Instnt dashboard and enabling OTP in your workflow. Refer to the [OTP](https://support.instnt.org/hc/en-us/articles/4408781136909#heading-5) section of the Quickstart guide for more information.

Instnt SDK provides two Javascript library functions to enable OTP.

1. sendOTP (mobileNumber)
2. verifyOTP(mobileNumber, otpCode)

Please refer to the Library function listing below for more details. 

## OTP flow

* User enters mobile number as part of the signup screen.
* Your app calls send OTP() SDK function and pass the mobile number.
* Instnt SDK calls Instnt API and returns the response upon successful OTP delivery.
* Your app shows the user a screen to enter the OTP code.
* User enters the OTP code which they received.
* Your app calls verify the OTP() SDK function to verify the OTP and pass mobile number and OTP code.
* Instnt SDK calls Instnt API and returns the response upon successful OTP verification


# Event processing

Your application can listen to the [events](#events) emitted by Instnt's SDK and respond to it. Below is a sample event handler:

```java
const onEventHandler = (event) => {
    switch (event.type) {
      case "transaction.initiated":
        setInstnt(event.data.instnt);
        instntRef.current = event.data.instnt;
        break;
      case "document.captured":
        // If necesary capture the setting and results for further review before upload
        setDocumentSettings(event.data.documentSettings);
        setCaptureResult(event.data.captureResult);
        handleNext();
        break;
      case "document.capture-cancelled":
        // Reset any relevant settings
        handleBack();
        break;
      case "document.uploaded":
        // Trigger docVerification when all uploads are done 
        if (activeStepRef.current >= 12) {
          instntRef.current.verifyDocuments(documentType);
          instntRef.current.submitData(instntRef.current.formData);
          handleNext();
        } 
        break;
      case "transaction.processed":
        setDecision(event.data.decision);
        handleNext();
        break;
      case ".error":
      case event.type.match(/.error/)?.input:
        console.log("Received instnt error event: " + event.type);
        setMessage(event.data);
        setShowMessageDrawer(true);
        break;
      default:
        console.log("unhandled instnt event ", event);
    }
  }
  ```

# FAQ

### What if I want to add some custom text fields onto my workflows?

After setting up the InstntSignupProvider component, install the following **Material UI** components and import the text field using the following commands:

```jsx
npm install @material-ui/core

import { TextField } from '@material-ui/core'
```

Once the components have been installed and imported, collect data from the user as shown below:

```jsx
  <TextField
    id='email'
    type='email'
    label='Email'
    value={data['email']}
    onChange={onChange}
  />
```

The 'email' text here is used as an **example** and can be anything you'd like to appear on the workflow. Always include the value and onChange fields as written in the example above, as they mark the text field as data to be passed through the InstntSignupProvider component.

### Minimum requirements

The minimum supported version of React is v17.0.0 If you use an older version,
upgrade React to use this library.

### What about other components like **InstntSignup**  or **InstntCustomSignup**

These are Instnt's legacy React components. These components are kept for backward compatibility but will be removed from the SDK in the future. For any new integration we recommend to use **InstntSignupProvider** instead of InstntSignup or InstntCustomSignup components. InstntSignupProvider is also required to implement features like Document Verification or OTP.
